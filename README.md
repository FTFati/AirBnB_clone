## Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project:
The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
* A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
* A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
